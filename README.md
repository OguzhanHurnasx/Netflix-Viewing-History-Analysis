#Netflix-Viewing-History-Analysis

This project was created to improve my basic data analysis skills using my own Netflix viewing history. Some seasonal and temporal analyses were made using the Python programming language and the pandas library.

I tried to learn and apply string splitting methods with extract and regex.
-I learned how to use the size() function.

-I learned how to convert data to datetime.

Note: Dataset 📁📁📁
The data consists of the NetflixViewingHistory.csv file downloaded from my Netflix account. Each row contains a watched content and the corresponding watch date information.

Future Plans 📌📌📌
By expanding the project:
Visualization (matplotlib / seaborn), #this has been done :heavy_check_mark:

Total watch time calculations 

...are planned to be included.

For now, I consider it sufficient in its current form. It was a simple and applicable beginner project focused on learning.
